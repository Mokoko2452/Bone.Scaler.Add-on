# Bone Scaler Add-on

**Bone Scaler** is a clean and user-focused edit mode add-on for Blender. It allows you to easily control B-Bone thickness with a single slider. The add-on works on selected bones or all bones, speeding up your workflow.

This add-on was created to restore the functionality of the **Bone Display Size** feature, which was removed starting from Blender 4.5. Enjoy using it!

* Slider affects selected bones; if none are selected, it applies to all bones
